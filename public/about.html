            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
              At Honeycomb we know support systems are hard to come by. We know what it’s like to feel like you’re going through it alone, but we also know nothing could be further from the truth. We are a sisterhood, connected by our common experience. By uniting and encouraging each other in self-love and self-belief, we thrive. Honest, strong, and always beautiful from the inside out, we are taking a step forward for all women – together.
            </p>
            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p>
              At home and online, we exist as a sisterhood to provide a platform for positive guidance/support, and to express opinions and ideas freely and without judgement. We are dedicated to making personal growth a daily activity in young women’s lives.
